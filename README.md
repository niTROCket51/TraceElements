## Gesture Recognition with OpenCV on Python

A collection of some algorithms to identify hand gestures. *(Gestures of paper, scissor and rock in this case)*

- **Algorithm 1:**
[By drawing the convex hull and finding convexity defects](/ConvexHull%26Defect.ipynb)
- //TODO **Algorithm 2:**
Using ends of fingers as markers
- //TODO **Algorithm 3:**
Using Machine Learning

### Prerequisites

Python 3 (Jupyter notebook) is required to run the project with following dependencies:
<br>
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)

### Installation

Download and install `Jupyter Notebook` from their [official page](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) or with Python's package manager, `pip`:
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install jupyter
```

Then install the dependecies:
```
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
```
